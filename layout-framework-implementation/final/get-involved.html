                        <li>I will dress and act in an appropriate manner at all times.</li>
                        <li>I will follow the established rules and guidelines of Special Olympics Minnesota and/or any agency involved with OMGAA Storm Special Olympics.</li>
                        <li>I will not promote religious or political beliefs or preferences while volunteering.</li>
                        <li>I will report any emergencies to the appropriate authorities after first taking immediate action to ensure the health and safety of the participants.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The relationship between Special Olympics and volunteers is an “at will” arrangement and may be terminated at any time without cause by either the volunteer or OMGAA Storm Special Olympics.</p>

                    <h2>Coaches</h2>
                    <h3>Coaches are role models and character builders. Coaches give Special Olympics athletes the most immediate awareness of their own worth, ability, courage and capacity to grow and improve.</h3>
