                        <p class="about-text">Special Olympics is a global movement of people creating a new world of inclusion and community. We aim to build a culture that accepts and welcomes every single person regardless of ability or disability. We are helping to make the world a better, healthier and more joyful place—one athlete, one volunteer, one family member at a time.</p>
                        <p class="about-text">Special Olympics Minnesota (SOMN) trainings and competitions happen all year in locations across the state. We offer 16 Olympic-style sports. As a result, SOMN has something for you, whatever your age or skill level. OMGAA Special Olympics is the Maple Grove-Osseo specal olympics club, primarily recruiting players from these areas.</p>
                        <p class="about-text">Through sports, our athletes celebrate their abilities, not their disabilities. Their world opens with acceptance and understanding, while becoming confident and empowered by their accomplishments. They make new friends, joining the most inclusive community on the planet—a global community that’s growing every day.</p>

                        <h2 class="about-subtitle">Philosophy</h2>
                        <p class="about-text">Special Olympics Minnesota believes that people with intellectual disabilities can, with proper instruction and encouragement, learn, enjoy and benefit from participation in individual and team sports. Necessary adaptation ensures we meet the needs of those with intellectual and physical disabilities.</p>
                        <p class="about-text">We believe that consistent training is essential to the development of sports skills. Due to competition among those of equal abilities, athletes receive the most appropriate means to test skills, measure progress and provide incentives for personal growth.</p>
                        <p class="about-text">In addition, we believe that through sports training and competition, people with intellectual disabilities benefit physically, mentally and socially. As a result, families are strengthened, and the community at large unites in understanding people with intellectual disabilities. Furthermore, this mindset creates an environment of equality, respect and acceptance.</p>

                        <h2 class="about-subtitle">Mission</h2>
                        <p class="about-text">Special Olympics Minnesota offers children and adults with intellectual disabilities year-round sports training and competition. Through Special Olympics’ athletic, health and leadership programs, people with intellectual disabilities transform themselves, their communities and the world.</p>

                        <h2 class="about-subtitle">Vision</h2>
                        <p class="about-text">Special Olympics Minnesota will be recognized as the premier organization providing essential life skills opportunities for children and adults with intellectual disabilities. Above all, our athletes derive the full benefit of our mission through multi-level, year-round sports opportunities and related health and leadership programs.</p>
